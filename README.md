# <samp>Ilya Kost // Software Engineer & Systems Architect</samp>

> I build robust, elegant systems. Mostly because I can't stand using poorly made ones.

### <samp>My Approach</samp>

I operate on a few straightforward principles that seem to be surprisingly uncommon.

1.  **Complexity is a bug, not a feature.** My primary goal is to take inherently complex problems and build solutions that are simple, predictable, and maintainable. If a system requires a 200-page manual to be understood, it's broken.

2.  **Code ships, meetings don't.** I have a strong bias for action and rapid prototyping. A tangible result, even an imperfect one, is infinitely more productive than endless debate about theoretical perfection.

3.  **High standards are just good laziness.** I build things to be scalable and resilient from the start because I have zero interest in being woken up at 3 AM. It's not about idealism; it's about pragmatism.

### <samp>Toolkit</samp>

I use the best tool for the job. And I have strong opinions on what makes a tool "best."

### <samp>What I'm Looking For</samp>

My skills are best applied to deep architectural challenges, hard scaling problems, or zero-to-one product engineering. I am explicitly not interested in maintaining legacy systems or building another standard CRUD application.

If you have a genuinely hard problem and need someone who will actually solve it, let's talk.
